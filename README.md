> unsigned varint in use in multiformat specs

This unsigned varint (VARiable INTeger) format is for the use in all the multiformats.

## Format

Our unsigned varint is an MSB based unsigned varint.

### Spec

The encoding is:
- unsigned integers are serialized 7 bits at a time, starting with the least significant bits
- the most significant bit (msb) in each output byte indicates if there is a continuation byte (msb = 1)
- there are no signed integers
- integers are minimally encoded

Examples: 

```
1 (0x01)        => 00000001 (0x01)
127 (0x7f)      => 01111111 (0x7f)
128 (0x80)      => 10000000 00000001 (0x8001)
255 (0xff)      => 11111111 00000001 (0xff01)
300 (0x012c)    => 10101100 00000010 (0xac02)
16384 (0x4000)  => 10000000 10000000 00000001 (0x808001)
```

```
byte   # |              0 |            1   |          2     |
bit    # |c 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 |c 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 |c 4 3 2 1 0 7 6 |
         |----------------|----------------|----------------|
16384 => |1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 |1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 |
```

Code that generates this.
```
package main

// test program. we can use the go one.
import (
  "encoding/binary" // varint is here
  "fmt"
)

func main() {
  ints := []uint64{1, 127, 128, 255, 300, 16384}
  for _, i := range ints {
    buf := make([]byte, 10)
    n := binary.PutUvarint(buf, uint64(i))

    hexStr := fmt.Sprintf("%x", i)
    if len(hexStr)%2 == 1 {
      hexStr = "0" + hexStr
    }
    fmt.Print(i, " (0x"+hexStr+")\t=> ")
    for c := 0; c < n; c++ {
      fmt.Printf("%08b ", int(buf[c]))
    }
    fmt.Printf("(0x%x)\n", buf[:n])
  }
}
```



### Practical maximum of 9 bytes (for security)

For security, to avoid memory attacks, we use a "practical max" of 9 bytes. Though there is no theoretical limit, and future specs can grow this number if it is truly necessary to have code or length values equal to or larger than `2^63`.

For the forseeable future:

- Implementations MUST restrict the size of the varint to a max of 9 bytes (63 bits).
- A multiformat spec MAY explicitly declare a smaller maximum when using varints.
- A multiformat spec MAY NOT explicitly declare a larger maximum when using varints without first changing this spec.

### Main differences from Go Varint

This MSB-based unsigned varint is based on the [varint of the Go standard library](https://golang.org/src/encoding/binary/varint.go), which itself was based on the protocol buffers one.

However, we have two modifications:

- Multiformats varint only supports unsigned integers, the Go varint supports signed (using zig-zag encoding).
- Multiformats varints must be minimally encoded. That is, numbers must be encoded in the least number of bytes possible.

> What do we mean by minimally encoded?

Multiformat varints must be encoded in as few bytes as possible. To illustrate
the issue, take `{0x81 0x00}`. This is a valid golang varint encoding of 0x1.
However, the _minimal_ encoding of 0x1 is `{0x1}`.
